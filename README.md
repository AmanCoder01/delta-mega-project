# Mega Project AirBnb Clone

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Airbnb offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn some income from their property. Guests often find that Airbnb rentals are cheaper and homier than hotels.
